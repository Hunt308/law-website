# law-website

There are a lot of laywers in my family and this design had a lot of concepts I have not used before. So I built this with a lot of CSS. 
-Figured out overlays and transitions for the images 
-Put color width and height and half the page with a different way
-Very responsive with many media queries 
-Learned about widths and heights and using the proper html naming and divs. 
-First time using animation with keyframes for things to come in
-First time using font awesome 5. Use the icons to show the meaning behind things in law
-Using the smooth scroll properly 

-Though I need to improve my set up for the media queries and I need to learn SASS so I don't have 
as much code and nested it with media queries in the right spot. Also need to work on responsive toggle menu
And need to improve my start with HTML. I don't need to use h2, h3 tags and p tags position bentter
